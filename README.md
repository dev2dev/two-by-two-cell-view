2x2 Grid View
=============

The 2x2 Grid View is a subclassed `UITableViewCell` used to create a nice grid 
display for a `UITableView` with a table style of `UITableViewStyleGrouped`.

You can read about the details on [calgary's awesome iPhone dev site - yycApps.com][3]

History
-------

The 2x2 Grid View originated from an iPhone app that was going to display MLS
information on the phone. Since CREA released their iPhone app that does the same
thing, and they don't have to pay to use the MLS data, my partners and
I decided to kill the app idea. So sad!
